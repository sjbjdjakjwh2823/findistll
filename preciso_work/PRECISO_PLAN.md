# Preciso: The Sovereign AI Toolkit for Financial Intelligence

## Vision
To build the world's most advanced, B2B-ready toolkit for financial data refinement and decision intelligence. Preciso will surpass Palantir in data precision and Scale AI in agentic reasoning, delivering a "zero-error" platform for institutions that cannot afford mistakes.

## Strategic Objectives
1.  **Modular Toolkit**: Decouple FinDistill (Refinement) and FinRobot (Intelligence) as sellable, standalone products.
2.  **Unparalleled Data Quality**: Implement "Self-Correcting Data Pipelines" (Pillar 1) to ensure 99.9% ground truth accuracy.
3.  **Future-Ready Reasoning**: Leverage Causal and Temporal reasoning (Pillar 2 & 3) to enable true predictive power.
4.  **Premium UX/UI**: Deliver a "Palantir-Gold / Scale-Sleek" interface that screams authority and technical excellence.

## 🏗️ Product Architecture

### 1) FinDistill Engine (Data Refinement Toolkit)
*   **Core**: Multi-modal ingestion (PDF, XBRL, CSV, News).
*   **The differentiator**: **Reflection-Agent Extraction**. Instead of one-pass extraction, it uses a critique-repair loop to verify every number and relationship.
*   **Output**: Clean, normalized, "Audit-Ready" facts with full CoT traceability.

### 2) FinRobot Intelligence (Decision Toolkit)
*   **Layer 1 (Agents)**: Domain-specific experts (Equity, Macro, Risk).
*   **Layer 2 (LLM Logic)**: Multi-model orchestration (GPT-5, Claude 3.5, etc.).
*   **Layer 3 (Workflow)**: Human-in-the-loop approval gates.
*   **Layer 4 (Foundation)**: Hybrid retrieval (RAG-FLARKO) connecting facts to intuition.

### 3) The Oracle (Predictive Spoke E)
*   **Tech**: PC Algorithm + NOTEARS + TimeGate GAT.
*   **Goal**: Move from "What happened?" to "What will happen if X changes?" (Causal Counterfactuals).

## 🎨 Design & Frontend (UI/UX)
*   **Benchmark**: Palantir Foundry (Dense/Authoritative) + Scale AI (Modern/Agent-Native).
*   **Design Tokens**:
    *   **Theme**: Deep Obsidian Dark Mode / Glassmorphism.
    *   **Typography**: Inter (UI) / JetBrains Mono (Data/CoT).
    *   **Components**:
        *   **Ontology Graph**: Interactive temporal graph (nodes change over time).
        *   **Decision Timeline**: A linear history of evidence → reasoning → final decision.
        *   **Audit Vault**: Immutable, cryptographically signed logs.
*   **User Interaction**: "Agent-First". Every panel is actionable by both humans and AI agents.

---

## 🚀 Operational Excellence (Zero-Error)
*   **CI/CD**: Automated unit tests for every Spoke (Pillars 1-4).
*   **Monitoring**: Real-time hallucination detection and alerting.
*   **Reliability**: "Materialize-on-demand" logic for all cloud assets (no deadlocks).

## Roadmap (B2B Pivot)

### Phase 1: Engine Hardening (Current)
*   [x] Pillar 1 (Self-Reflection) in FinDistill.
*   [x] Pillar 3 (Temporal Logic) in Spoke D/E.
*   [ ] Pillar 2 (Causal Inference) implementation in Spoke E.

### Phase 2: Frontend Overhaul (Next)
*   [ ] Redesign UI with "Palantir + Scale" aesthetics.
*   [ ] Build "Decision Timeline" component.
*   [ ] Implement "Ontology Explorer" for Spoke D.

### Phase 3: Toolkit Packaging (Future)
*   [ ] Create SDK/API documentation for B2B clients.
*   [ ] Implement multi-tenant architecture.
*   [ ] Expand to non-financial data distribution (Logistics, Energy).

## Next Action: UI Prototyping
1.  Analyze Palantir/Scale UI components in detail.
2.  Generate initial React/Next.js components for the new "Decision Composer".
3.  Establish the "Preciso Design System" (CSS Variables, Tokens).
